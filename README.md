# Jess Lark Portfolio 2025

## Ideas and Plans
- extrapolate nav and footer in own components
- add projects
- add blog
- create dark and light templates
- add ability to see page without styling
- add favicon
- check accessibility
- tests
- spell check
- get design and grammar and etc feedback
- actually write some blog posts
  - French, books, learning stuff, etc

## What Is This For

This is a project to display some of my favorite projects, and to host my blog.

## Why Build it This Way

React is fun and the primary technology I work with at work. I used CRA for two reasons: 
- One, it's a very low barrier to entry for people who are comfortable in React but haven't used the currently recommended frameworks.
- Two, I've been intending to get more comfortable with fixing dependencies and this seems like a great opportunity to learn. 

## Hosting

This project is hosted on hithub pages because it is free and easy to use.

## Updating the App
Change the JSX and see what happens!

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
